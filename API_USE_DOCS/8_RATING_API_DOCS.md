# ExtraBite Rating Module API Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the Rating Module APIs that allow donors and receivers to rate each other after completing a donation.

---

## Overview

The Rating Module enables users to provide feedback and ratings for each other after a donation request is completed. This helps build trust and transparency in the community.

### Key Features:

- **Bidirectional Rating**: Both donors and receivers can rate each other
- **Rating Validation**: Only completed donation requests can be rated
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Users can only rate once per donation request
- **Automatic Statistics**: User average ratings are automatically calculated
- **Rating Breakdown**: Detailed statistics including star distribution

---

## Authentication

All rating endpoints require authentication. Include the JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

2. **Only participants** (donor or receiver) can rate the donation request
3. **One rating per user** per donation request
4. **Rating values** must be between 1-5 stars

### Rating Calculation

1. **Average rating** is automatically calculated and updated
2. **Rating statistics** include breakdown by star ratings
3. **User profile** shows the current average rating

### Data Integrity

1. **Transaction management** ensures data consistency
2. **Validation** prevents invalid ratings
3. **Duplicate prevention** maintains rating integrity

## Integration Examples

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
// Submit a rating
const submitRating = async (donationRequestId, rating, comment) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("/api/ratings/submit", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        donationRequestId,
        rating,
        comment,
      }),
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      const result = await response.json();
      console.log("Rating submitted:", result);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error submitting rating:", error);
  }
};

// Check if user can rate
const canRate = async (donationRequestId) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/ratings/can-rate/${donationRequestId}`, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      },
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      const result = await response.json();
      return result.canRate;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error checking rating eligibility:", error);
  }
  return false;
};
```

### Mobile App Integration

```dart
// Flutter/Dart example
class RatingService {
  static Future<bool> submitRating({
    required int donationRequestId,
    required int rating,
    String? comment,
  }) async {
    try {
      final response = await http.post(
        Uri.parse('$baseUrl/api/ratings/submit'),
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'Authorization': 'Bearer $token',
        },
        body: jsonEncode({
          'donationRequestId': donationRequestId,
          'rating': rating,
          'comment': comment,
        }),
      );

      return response.statusCode == 200;
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error submitting rating: $e');
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Test Cases

1. **Valid Rating Submission**

   - Submit rating for completed donation request
   - Verify rating is saved and user average is updated

2. **Invalid Rating Values**

   - Try to submit rating < 1 or > 5
   - Verify validation error is returned

3. **Duplicate Rating Prevention**

   - Submit rating for same donation request twice
   - Verify second submission is rejected

4. **Unauthorized Rating**

   - Try to rate donation request user didn't participate in
   - Verify access is denied

5. **Incomplete Donation Request**
   - Try to rate donation request that's not completed
   - Verify rating is rejected

### Sample Test Data

```json
{
  "donationRequestId": 123,
  "rating": 5,
  "comment": "Test rating for documentation"
}
```

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid JWT token
2. **Authorization**: Users can only rate donation requests they participated in
3. **Input Validation**: Rating values and comments are validated
4. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using JPA repositories with parameterized queries
5. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for rating submissions

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Indexing**: Ensure proper indexes on rating tables
2. **Caching**: Consider caching user rating summaries
3. **Batch Updates**: Rating statistics are updated efficiently
4. **Pagination**: For large rating lists, consider implementing pagination

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rating Categories**: Different rating criteria (communication, food quality, etc.)
2. **Rating Moderation**: Admin approval for ratings
3. **Rating Analytics**: Advanced analytics and reporting
4. **Rating Notifications**: Email/SMS notifications for new ratings
5. **Rating Disputes**: System for handling rating disputes
